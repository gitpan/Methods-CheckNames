NAME
    Methods::CheckNames - Statically check for named methods

SYNOPSIS
            my Foo $object;

            $object->method(); # dies at compile time unless a method can be found

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables simplistic checking of method names for typed my
    variables.

    It's not much more than a proof of concept.

TODO
    *   Use the "can" meta method instead of "gv_fetchmethod"

    *   Make the checking pluggable

VERSION CONTROL
    This module is maintained using git. You can get the latest version from
